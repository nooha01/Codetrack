Given a list D of N integers, and an integer T, two numbers L and R are randomly chosen such that 0 ≤ L ≤ R < N.

What is the probability that sum{D[L],... D[R]} <= T ?

Input Format

The first line will contain two numbers: N and T.
N lines follow, each containing one number from list D.
Constraints

1 <= N < 100000
0 <= D[i] < 1e7
Output Format

Output one number P to a maximum of 8 decimal places, the probability that sum{D[L],... D[R]} <= T.
