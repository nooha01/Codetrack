As part of the Hestiaâ€˜22 CS department is organising a surprise coding test in which Derek has to solve a problem. Help Derek solve this problem, the problem statement is as follows:

Two strings are given to the participants, determine if they are isomorphic. Assume that s and t are two strings. They are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. It should satisfy the following conditions: i)All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. ii)No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
