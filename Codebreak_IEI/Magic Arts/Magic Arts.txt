The New Online Multiplayer game Magic Arts has attracted all gamers nationwide owing to its interactive gameplay. The game is divided into levels, with a boss at the end of each level who must be defeated in order to clear the level and proceed. At some time of the day, n players log in and start playing the game. Each boss can be defeated by spending some Magic Points(MP) , but the thing is that every player has limited amount of points. Also, based on their previous progress , every player is currently at some level. Each level of the game has a resting inn, a weapon-dealer and a necromancer who can rejuvenate their magic points.

You, being a software intern at MagiWorks(the developer company of Magic arts) have to write a program which tells at what level will a player run out of magic and will visit the necromancer to rejuvenate their magic.

The first line of the input contains 2 space separated integers n and m, which denote number of levels of MagicArts and number of online players respectively.

The second line will contain n space separated integers , the i'th integer being xi , which denotes the amount of magic points required to defeat the monster at i'th level.

Then follow m lines where the i'th line contains 2 space separated integers ai and pi which denote the current level and magic points of the i'th player respectively.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 105
1 <= m <= 105
1 <= xi <= 109
1 <= ai <= n
1 <= pi <= 109
Output Format
