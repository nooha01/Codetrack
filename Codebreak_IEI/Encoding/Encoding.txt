Sanjay and febin are friends

They want to change every message into binary representaion B of length N

Then it is written down K times, shifted by 0,1,..,K-1 bits.

If B = 1001010 and and it looks so:

1001010
01001010
001001010
0001001010

Then calculate XOR in every column and write it down. This number is called . For example, XOR-ing the numbers in the above example results in

1110100110

Then the encoded message and are sent to Sanjay.

Febin is using this encoding algorithm and asks Sanjay to decrpt it Can you help Sanjay implement this?
