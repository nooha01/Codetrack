SOLID
S- Single responsibility  
O- Open/Closed principle 
L- Liskov substitution principle : subclass should extend the capability of parent class, not narrow it down
I- Interface segmented principle
D- Dependency inversion

if class B is a subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A without breaking the behaviour of the program.
